Hi, my name is Brad Fitzwater.  As a Software Developer, I spend a large portion of my day building stuff in C#, but usually spend my free time experimenting in other languages.  I try to constantly be learning, and my current obsessions are API design and environment automation.

Originally from Charleston, WV; I moved to Blacksburg,VA after graduating from Marshall University. I am on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/bradfitzwater), [Github](https://github.com/brad-f), and [LinkedIn] (https://linkedin.com/in/bradfitzwater).
